# The Pet Simulator

## Project description
***
There might've been more to this project, but there isn't. Using this project, you can create virtual pets and interact with them. You have 1 job. Keep them alive. It is very easy for them to die. Here is a list of ways:  
+ The pet starves if hunger gets greater than 6
+ The pet is overfed if hunger gets less than -2
+ The pet is too depressed if happiness reaches 0
+ The pet gets overworked if energy is greater than 8
+ The pet has too much energy/doesn't do enough if energy is less than 0
+ The pet gets too sick if they are sick for more than 4 days  
In all of these cases, the pet dies. you can view all your pets in the main menu, along with specific stats of them. You can also create pets and access the pet menu from there, creating and interacting with pets.  

## Execution and Usage
***
The usage is simple: type the number of the thing you want to do. It will display optoins in the terminal.
